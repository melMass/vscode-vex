# VEX Syntax for VSCode

----
Hi all, I've just updated the extension to add **Houdini 18 definitions**.
I started a complete rewrite a year ago, with a proper language server, it's almost ready but I still have a few things to add.
Briefly it will add:
- Simple error checking
- Much better Popup documentation (A limitation of snippets in VSCode).
- Settings.

---

# Features
- VEX Language Support (Syntax).
- Base Snippets.
- Functions descriptions with attributes.
